Animation? Like the fallout 4 one? If so im doing pixel art. Order 1. Goes To 2. Goes Down 3. Zooms into
-Should be simple pixel art
- 1st part = computer on long desk with things flashing... at a distance
- 2nd part = zoom into the desk with the computer, both should be visable item on computer is still not visable
- 3rd part = at the computer and you can finally see that its a terminal
After those 3 parts we replace the animation and make it an actual useable terminal 
Do Animation Tommorrow;


Interactable Terminal  Why I thought of this -Recently Created LinuxApacheMysqlPhp (LAMP) stack on ubuntu server, Been playing fallout 4.
-Commands:
help
SP (stands for Switch Page takes a additional argument to either make that page a new tab or move out of the terminal)
testing (prints some random word from a list i dunno)

Be able to login (me only) to see additional commands
Login is 
-Be able to switch to a non-terminal version, for non-technical people


Logo (made from initials) in top corner. for websites that arent the terminal
Logo will be a vector graphic rather than a raster so it will always have good quality and will be in svg format, I used inkscape to draw it
